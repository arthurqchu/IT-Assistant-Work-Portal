# IT-Assistant-Work-Portal

This is a simple site used to access the different sites and documents we use at work (logging events, taking inventory, checking our schedules).

This site is designed to be used with NFC tags and mobile devices. The NFC tags should be placed at the help desk and wherever inventory is taken.
